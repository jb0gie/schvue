              Schwepe was not always the lord of the metaverse. He was once a
              humble programmer who worked for a company called Meta. One day,
              he accidentally spilled a can of Schwepe's on his keyboard, which
              caused a glitch in the code he was writing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl m-5">
              The glitch gave him access to the core of the metaverse, where he
              discovered a hidden power that allowed him to manipulate reality.
              He decided to use his power to create a new world in his own
              image, where everything was pink and sparkly.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl m-5">
              He also changed his name to Schwepe, after his favorite drink, and
              declared himself the lord and ironic creator of the metaverse. He
              now rules over his pink domain with an iron fist, and anyone who
              dares to oppose him will face his wrath. Schwepe is feared and
              revered by all, but secretly, he is lonely and bored. He wishes he
              had someone to share his pink world with, someone who would
              appreciate his sense of humor and his love for Schweppes.
